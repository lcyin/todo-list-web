# Todo List React Application Development Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 5, 2025

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

This document outlines the development plan for a modern, responsive React single-page application (SPA) to serve as a frontend for the "Todo List API". The application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing todo items, implementing all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities exposed by the API.

The primary goal is to create a well-structured, maintainable, and performant application that accurately reflects the capabilities of the backend API as defined in the api-docs.json file.

## 2. Analysis of the API Specification

The provided OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification details a standard RESTful API for managing todos. Key takeaways are:

**Resources:** The primary resource is a Todo object with fields like id, title, description, completed, and timestamps.

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/v1/todos`: Fetch a list of todos. Supports pagination (page, limit) and filtering (completed, search).
- `POST /api/v1/todos`: Create a new todo.
- `GET /api/v1/todos/{id}`: Fetch a single todo.
- `PUT /api/v1/todos/{id}`: Update an existing todo.
- `DELETE /api/v1/todos/{id}`: Delete a todo.

**Data Models:** Clear schemas are provided for Todo, CreateTodoRequest, UpdateTodoRequest, and response envelopes, which will be used to generate TypeScript types.

**Health Checks:** Health endpoints (`/api/v1/health/*`) are available but will not be implemented in the user-facing UI.

## 3. Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Sprint 0)

This phase focuses on establishing the development environment, project structure, and core dependencies.

### 3.1. Technology Stack Selection

**Framework:** React 18+

**Bootstrapping:** Vite for a fast development experience.

**Language:** TypeScript. The API spec is well-defined, making TypeScript ideal for type safety.

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first UI development.

**API Client:** Axios for robust HTTP requests and interceptors.

**State Management:**

- **Server State:** TanStack Query (React Query) is highly recommended. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server state, perfectly handling loading, error, and success states for API interactions.
- **UI State:** React Context API or Zustand for minimal global UI state (e.g., theme, modal visibility).

### 3.2. Initial Setup Tasks

**Initialize Project:**

```bash
npm create vite@latest todo-app -- --template react-ts
```

**Install Dependencies:**

```bash
cd todo-app
npm install axios @tanstack/react-query tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

**Configure Tailwind CSS:** Initialize the Tailwind configuration files.

**Project Structure:** Create the following directory structure inside `/src`:

```text
/src
|-- /api/            # API client generation and hooks
|-- /components/     # Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal)
|-- /features/       # Feature-specific components (TodoList, TodoItem)
|-- /hooks/          # Custom hooks
|-- /pages/          # Top-level page components
|-- /types/          # Generated TypeScript types
|-- /utils/          # Utility functions
|-- App.tsx
|-- main.tsx
```

**API Type & Client Generation:**

- Use a tool like openapi-typescript-codegen to automatically generate TypeScript types from the components.schemas in api-docs.json.
- This tool can also generate a fully typed Axios client, which drastically reduces manual boilerplate and prevents type mismatches between the frontend and backend.
- **Action:** Add a script to package.json to run this generation process.

**Environment Configuration:**

- Create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files.
- Define `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to `http://localhost:3000` for development and `https://api.todolist.com` for production.

## 4. Phase 2: Feature Development (Sprints 1-3)

This phase is broken down into sprints, each delivering a core piece of functionality.

### Sprint 1: Read & Display Todos

**Goal:** Display a list of all todos from the API.

**Tasks:**

- **API Layer:** Create a custom hook `useGetTodos` using TanStack Query's useQuery that calls the `GET /api/v1/todos` endpoint.
- **Component:** `TodoItem.tsx`: Create a component to display a single todo. It should show the title and a checkbox representing the completed status.
- **Component:** `TodoList.tsx`: This component will call `useGetTodos`, handle the loading and error states (displaying a spinner or error message), and map over the resulting data to render a list of `TodoItem` components.
- **Page:** `TodosPage.tsx`: Assemble the main page layout, including a header and the `TodoList` component.
- **Initial Styling:** Apply basic Tailwind CSS for a clean, readable list.

### Sprint 2: Create & Delete Todos

**Goal:** Allow users to add new todos and delete existing ones.

**Tasks:**

- **Component:** `AddTodoForm.tsx`: Create a form with an input field for the title and a submit button.
- **API Layer (Create):** Create a hook `useCreateTodo` using useMutation. On success (`onSuccess`), it must invalidate the "todos" query to trigger an automatic refetch of the list.
- **API Layer (Delete):** Create a hook `useDeleteTodo` using useMutation. It will also invalidate the "todos" query on success.
- **Integration (Create):** Integrate `AddTodoForm.tsx` into `TodosPage.tsx`. Wire its form submission to the `useCreateTodo` mutation.
- **Integration (Delete):** Add a "Delete" button to the `TodoItem.tsx` component. Clicking it will call the `useDeleteTodo` mutation with the todo's id.
- **UI Feedback:** Implement optimistic updates (optional but recommended for a better UX) or show loading indicators on the buttons while mutations are in progress.

### Sprint 3: Update Todos & Advanced Functionality

**Goal:** Enable editing of todos, filtering, searching, and pagination.

**Tasks:**

- **API Layer (Update):** Create a `useUpdateTodo` hook using useMutation.
- **Update (Toggle Completion):** Wire the checkbox in `TodoItem.tsx` to the `useUpdateTodo` mutation, toggling the completed status. This provides a quick way to mark tasks as done.
- **Update (Editing Form - Optional):** Implement an "edit" mode for `TodoItem.tsx`. Clicking an "Edit" button could reveal an inline form to change the title and description.
- **Filtering Controls:** Add UI controls (e.g., buttons or a dropdown) to filter todos by "All", "Active", and "Completed". These controls will update a state variable that is passed to the `useGetTodos` hook's query parameters.
- **Search Input:** Add a search bar. The value of this input will be debounced and used as the search query parameter for the `useGetTodos` hook.
- **Pagination Controls:** Using the pagination object from the API response (page, totalPages, total), build "Previous" and "Next" buttons and/or page number indicators. These will control the page query parameter sent to the API.

## 5. Phase 3: UI/UX Polish & Refinement (Sprint 4)

**Goal:** Enhance the user experience and ensure a polished final product.

**Tasks:**

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the layout is fully responsive and usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Tailwind's responsive prefixes.
- **User Feedback:** Implement a toast notification system (e.g., react-hot-toast) to provide non-blocking feedback for actions like "Todo created successfully" or "Error deleting todo".
- **Empty & Edge Case States:** Design and implement views for when the todo list is empty, or when a search/filter returns no results.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Review the application for accessibility. Ensure proper use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.

## 6. Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Ensure the application is robust and bug-free.

**Tasks:**

- **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - Set up Vitest and React Testing Library.
  - Write unit tests for simple, reusable components (Button, Input).
  - Write integration tests for user flows (e.g., "a user can add a todo, and it appears in the list").
- **API Mocking:** Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept API calls during tests. This allows for testing the application's behavior with predictable API responses without needing a running backend.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and test on various devices.

## 7. Phase 5: Build & Deployment

**Goal:** Prepare and deploy the application for production.

**Tasks:**

- **Production Build:** Run `npm run build` to generate optimized, static assets.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the static output to a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3/CloudFront. These platforms offer seamless integration with Git repositories.
- **CI/CD:** Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate:
  - Running tests on every push/pull request.
  - Deploying the main branch to production automatically.
